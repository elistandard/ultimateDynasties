        <ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
          <li>UCSB won back-to-back-to-back twice, and you can see their slow climb from third in 1986 to second in 1987 to winning for the first time in 1988. But why didn't they make nationals in 1992? Only to lose in finals in 1993?</li>
          <li>Brown has a clear legacy in the early 2000s, with wins in 2000 and 2005, but a huge break from 2008 to 2017 before gaining dominance again in 2019 and 2024.</li>
          <li>North Carolina obviously another major legacy, making nationals every year since 2012. But they were late to the game, not making it for the first time until 1998, and missing nationals 7 years in the mid 2000s.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-600">
          <li>Texas with a history of mediocrity</li>
          <li>Oregon only winning once in 1992</li>
          <li>UMass getting second after missing nationals three years in a row</li>
          <li>Michigan never placing above third</li>
          <li>Florida dropping from first to dead last in 2010-2011</li>
          <li>Wisconsin getting 5th four years in a row</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">Women's Division Analysis</h2>
        <ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
          <li>Stanford is far and away the best women's team ever with eight championships. They even went back-to-back-to-back twice. They made nationals for the first time in 1995, lost in finals twice, won nationals three years in a row, and then didn't make nationals in 2000, only to go on another crazy seven year streak until they don't make it again in 2008.</li>
          <li>UCSB has also been strong, but with more concentrated spurts of success in 1988-1991 and 2007-2011. They also haven't missed a nationals since 2017.</li>
          <li>Carleton has only missed four nationals total in the history of the sport, but only have one national championship in 2000.</li>
          <li>UNC's four year win streak is unprecedented, as they're the only Men or Women's team to win four years in a row.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>UC Davis winning nationals in 2004 after not making it the three years prior and not making it again until two years after</li>
          <li>UBC's slow climb to the top since 2006 and inability to make it past semis since their win in 2008</li>
          <li>Oregon's dominance in the 2010s</li>
          <li>Dartmouth's back to back victories in 2017 and 2018 followed by a loss to UCSD in 2019</li>
